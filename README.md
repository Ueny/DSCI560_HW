## Project Description
  This project aims to visualize 1000 data points, and each one of them comes from our generalization. The X is generated by random numbers ranged from 0 to 100,     and the Y is generated based on X. The function y = 3x + 6 is implemented on each number of X, so we have Y. With the cordinates represented by X and Y, we are     able to build up a scattered plot of data distribution.

## DSCI560_HW2.ipynb:
  Run all the scripts in order, ans show up all the results with explanations.
  
## Execute Instructions
## Note: the instructions are based on the Mac OS environment and Python3

## Step 1: create a virtual environment
  - Clone the code to a local repository
  - In the same directory, run the command `pip install virtualenv` in your command to install the environment management tool.
  - Run the command `virtualenv dsci560H4` to create a virtual environment called *dsci560H4*

## Step 2: activate the virtual environment and check dependencies
  - Run the command `source dsci560H4/bin/activate` to activate this virtual environment

  - In the virtual environment, by running the command `pip freeze > requirements_original.txt` to extract dependencies.

    We can see that, there is no dependency.
    
  - However, considering we need the *matplotlib* package to help us do the visualization, we need to run the command first `pip install matplotlib`.

  - And then let's check the dependencies again.
  
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54614822/97098493-b5445280-163a-11eb-8c8c-7d1dde748b4c.png)

    So we know that, we'll have a list of dependencies after an installation of a package.
  
## Step 3: scripts introductions
  We have 3 scripts which need to be run in order, and the introductions are as follows.
  1. random_numbers.py:
    We use a random package to generate uniform numbers repeatedly, and the range of the random number is from 0 to 100. The process will be repeated for 1000 times. We are able to have a visualization about the distribution of the 1000 random numbers. The X axis represents the number ID from 1 to 1000, and the y axis represents number values.
  2. update_numbers.py:
    Based on previous 1000 random numbers, we implement a function y = 3x + 6 on each one, so we have new numbers from 6 to 306. We are also able to have a visualization about the distribution of the 1000 numbers. The X axis represents the number ID from 1 to 1000, and the y axis represents new values.
  3. visualization.py:
    Based on the previous data from *1.* and *2.*, we are going to have a data visualization with random numbers (*1.*) as X and after-function numbers (*2.*) as Y. We'll have a scattered plot.

## Step 4: run the scripts
   (Note: Please have a python3 and install a package matplotlib)
   - Run the script *random_numbers.py* first. Run the command `python3 random_numbers.py`. And we can see the result, 1000 generated random numbers.

   - Run the script *update_numbers.py* then. Run the command `python3 update_numbers.py`
   - Run the script *visualization.py* finally. RUn the command `python3 visualization.py`
 
## The final visualization result
