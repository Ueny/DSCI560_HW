## random_numbers.py (step 1):
  Generate 1000 random numbers ranged from 0 to 100.
  We use a random package to generate uniform numbers repeatedly, and the range of the random number is from 0 to 100. The process will be repeated for 1000 times.
## update_numbers.py (step 2):
  Based on previous 1000 random numbers, we implement a function y = 3x + 6 on each one, so we have new numbers.
## visualization.py (step 3):
  Based on the previous data from step 1 and 2, with the support of the visualization tool 'matplotlib', do a data visualization with random numbers (step 1) as X     and functioned numbers (step 2) as Y. The scattered plot is as follows.

## Running instructions:
   (Note: Please have a python version above 3 and install a package matplotlib)
   - python3 random_numbers.py
   - python3 update_numbers.py
   - python3 visualization.py
   
## DSCI560_HW2.ipynb:
  Run all the scripts in order, ans show up all the results with explanations.
